<h1>Important notes from stage 0</h1>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The web basics are</b>: <p><em>the web<br> html<br> urls<br> http<br> web applications</em></p>
<br>
<br>
The main type of document on the web is called <b>HTML</b>- Hypertext markup language. HTML consist of 4 different things:<p></p><em>Text content (what you see)<br> Markup (what it looks like)<br>Reference to another document (e.g. images+videos)<br>Links to other pages</em>
<br>
<br>
The markup is what we use to <b><em>change</b></em> the <em>normal</em> text into what we would like it look like.<br>
The way we do that is by using something called openig tag and closing tag, and that looks something like this:<p> < name> content < /name> </p> There are many different "name commands" and of course its impossible to remmember them all. But all you need is <a href=" https://www.google.es/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=tOYBVc_hLoOr8wfEnILABA&gws_rd=ssl">Google</a><br>
<br>
when you are making <b>commands</b> by using tags, you are at the same time creating <em>HTML elements</em>.<br>
<b>Elements</b> are everything inside an opening tag and a closing tag. some elements create an <em>invisible</em> box aorund them, those are called <b>block elements</b>the other type of elements are called <b>inline elements</b>. Take a look at <a href=""https://vimeo.com/36866534">this video</a> <br>
<br>
<h3>what can i use my new notes to?</h3>
I can for example. create webpages like <b>this</b>. but I have to be very carefull when i am writting elements, cause a computer can not <em>guess</em> what I am trying to tell it, it will <b>only</b> do exactly as i tell it, so I have to make sure I am typing correct.
